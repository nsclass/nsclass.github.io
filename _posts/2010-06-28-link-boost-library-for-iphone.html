<p>Once you compile the boost libraries you want, right click your target after you made your project, and click Get Info. Then go to the Build Tab and find the setting called "Header Search Paths." Add the path to your boost library there. Then, in the general tab, you should add in a Linked Library for any of the compiled Boost libraries that you're using. If they're statically linked, I think the extension is usually .a. If they're dynamically linked, the extension is .dylib.</p>

<p>Commenter Jonathan Scheepers <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#513263"><u><font color="#0000ff">wonders about those programs that flash their taskbar button indefinitely</font></u></a>, overriding the default flash count set by <code>SysteParametersInfo(SPI_SETFOREGROUNDFLASHCOUNT)</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>FlashWindowEx</code> function and its simpler precursor <code>FlashWindow</code> let a program flash its window caption and taskbar button manually. The window manager flashes the caption automatically (and Explorer follows the caption by flashing the taskbar button) if a program calls <code>SetForegroundWindow</code> when it doesn't have permission to take foreground, and it is that automatic flashing that the <code>SPI_SETFOREGROUNDFLASHCOUNT</code> setting controls.</p>
<p>For illustration purposes, I'll demonstrate flashing the caption manually. This is generally speaking not recommended, but since you asked, I'll show you how. And then promise you won't do it.</p>
<p>Start with the scratch program and make this simple change: </p>
<pre>void
OnSize(HWND hwnd, UINT state, int cx, int cy)
&#123;
  if (state == SIZE_MINIMIZED) &#123;
    FLASHWINFO fwi = &#123; sizeof(fwi), hwnd,
                       FLASHW_TIMERNOFG | FLASHW_ALL &#125;;
    FlashWindowEx(&amp;fwi);
  &#125;
&#125;
</pre>
<p>Compile and run this program, then minimize it. When you do, its taskbar button flashes indefinitely until you click on it. The program responds to being minimzed by calling the <code>FlashWindowEx</code> function asking for everything possible (currently the caption and taskbar button) to be flashed until the window comes to the foreground.</p>
<p>Other members of the <code>FLASHWINFO</code> structure let you customize the flashing behavior further, such as controlling the flash frequency and the number of flashes. and if you really want to take control, you can use <code>FLASHW_ALL</code> and <code>FLASHW_STOP</code> to turn your caption and taskbar button on and off exactly the way you want it. (Who knows, maybe you want to send a message in Morse code.) </p>

<p>I think that the following features in Rust will make it special.</p>
<p>1. Package manager.<br />
2. Functional style programming.<br />
3. No exception.<br />
4. No garbage collector.<br />
5. Compile time error detection for multi-threading programming.</p>
<p>However, I think that the following features make hard to master Rust programming language.<br />
1. Ownership, borrower and move semantic. (but if somebody has a strong C++ programming experience, this is easy to catch up)<br />
2. Lifetime indicator.</p>

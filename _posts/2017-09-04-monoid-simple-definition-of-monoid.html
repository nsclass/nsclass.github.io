<p>1. Closure: Two same type pair operation results a new result with same type.<br />
2. Associative: Doesn't matter or operation order wit a pair.<br />
3. Identity: There is an identity can always result the original value.</p>
<p>Integer plus:<br />
<pre class = "code">
1 + 2 = 3
(1 + 2) + 3 = 1 + (2 + 3)
1 + 0 = 1
0 + 1 = 1
</pre>
<p>String concatenation:<br />
<pre class = "code">
"1" + "2" = "12"
"1" + ("2" + "3") = ("1" + "2") + "3"
"" + "1" = "1"
"1" + "" = "1"
</pre>
<p>Importance of Monoids:<br />
Once it is identified that provided data is Monoid, it can be parallelized very easily.<br />
For instance, we can calculate the number of total sold items in a day from million items.</p>
<p>Map/Reduce<br />
<pre class = "code">
List.reduce(+)
</pre>
<p>Log file aggregation:<br />
From a giant log file, we can aggregate useful data such as what is the average request on Monday, Tuesday, ..., Sunday because String is Monoid.<br />
It is important to know that Metric data should be Monoid.</p>

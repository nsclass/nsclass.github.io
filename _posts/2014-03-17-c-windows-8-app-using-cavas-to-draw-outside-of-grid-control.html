<p>Canvas size is always child driven so it will give infinite size for children. Also HorizontalAlignment and VerticalAlignment settings have no effect on a child of a Canvas. However even Canvas size is to zero, it does not affect to draw children.<br />
By using this feature we can allow TextBloc to be displayed outside of Grid as shown the below example.</p>
{% highlight wl linenos %}
<Grid Width="200" Height="100">
    <Canvas>
        <TextBlock Text="Text in a Small Grid" FontSize="144" />
    </Canvas>
</Grid>
{% endhighlight %}

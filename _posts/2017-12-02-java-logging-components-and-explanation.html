<p>LOGGERS: loggers are responsible for capturing events and passing them to the appropriate appender.</p>
<p>APPENDERS: also known as handlers, appenders are responsible for recording log events to a destination. appenders use layouts to format events before sending them to an output.</p>
<p>LAYOUTS: also known as formatters, layouts are responsible for converting and formatting the data in a log event. layouts determine how the data looks when it appears in a log entry.</p>

<p>Monad is a binding function to connect two functions where are different types between returning value and input argument. So Monad will allow to compose two incompatible functions.</p>
<p>A monad is just a monoid in the category of endofunctors.</p>
<p>This is because Monad has the following properties<br />
1. Closure<br />
2. Associative<br />
3. Identity</p>

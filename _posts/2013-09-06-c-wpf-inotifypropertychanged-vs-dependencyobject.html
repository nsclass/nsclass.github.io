<p>In WPF for binding model data to UI you can choose DependencyObject or INotifyPropertyChanged with POCO.</p>
<p>I normally selected INotifyPropertyChanged with POCO because of code readability and easy to understand.<br />
Now I have found a useful article about this topic. You can see the details from the following link.</p>
<p>http://kentb.blogspot.com.au/2009/03/view-models-pocos-versus.html</p>
<p>One important thing is that DependencyObject has a relationship with thread affinity. I think that this is big weakness of DependencyObject even though it can bring a little bit of performance benefits.</p>

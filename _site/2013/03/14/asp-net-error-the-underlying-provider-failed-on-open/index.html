<p>context.Connection.Open() didn't help solving my problem so I tried enabling "Allow Remote Clients" in DTC config, no more error.</p>
<p>In windows 7 you can open the DTC config by running dcomcnfg, Component Services -&gt; Computers -&gt; My Computer -&gt; Distributed Transaction Coordinator -&gt; Right click to Local DTC -&gt; Security. â€“ kerem Mar 3 '11 at 16:48</p>

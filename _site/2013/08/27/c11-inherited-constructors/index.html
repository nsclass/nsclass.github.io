<p>Now C++11 allow that derived class can inherit the constructors of base class as the following.</p>
<p>[code lang="c"]<br />
class A<br />
{<br />
public:<br />
    A(int a) {}<br />
    A(std::string const&amp; str) {}<br />
    A(double a, int f) {}<br />
};</p>
<p>class B : public A<br />
{<br />
    using base::A;<br />
};<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>However, you need to be careful when if B has any member variable, they will be initialized with random values unless you initialize specifically.</p>

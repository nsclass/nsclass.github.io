<p>The main reason of using anonymous namespace in C++ is to localize declaration in translation unit.<br />
The compiler will choose the unique name for unnamed namespace so that it can guarantee that there are no conflict on using same name declaration such as class or enum etc.</p>
<p>Normally, static keyword is used in C to avoid name clashing problem but unnamed namespace in C++ will make it a lot easier.</p>

<p>Normally in order to improve the responsiveness of application, there are two areas that should be considered in modern memory machine architecture.</p>
<p>1. reduce latency<br />
- concurrency(shared memory architecture, distribution memory architecture)<br />
- optimizing cache fault for a shared memory machine architecture.</p>
<p>2. improve performance<br />
 - using better algorithm(Big O method)</p>

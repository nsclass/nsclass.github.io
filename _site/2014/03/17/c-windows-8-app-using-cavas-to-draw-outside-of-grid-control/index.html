<p>Canvas size is always child driven so it will give infinite size for children. Also HorizontalAlignment and VerticalAlignment settings have no effect on a child of a Canvas. However even Canvas size is to zero, it does not affect to draw children.<br />
By using this feature we can allow TextBloc to be displayed outside of Grid as shown the below example.</p>
<p>[code lang="html"]<br />
&lt;Grid Width=&quot;200&quot; Height=&quot;100&quot;&gt;<br />
    &lt;Canvas&gt;<br />
        &lt;TextBlock Text=&quot;Text in a Small Grid&quot; FontSize=&quot;144&quot; /&gt;<br />
    &lt;/Canvas&gt;<br />
&lt;/Grid&gt;<br />
[/code]</p>

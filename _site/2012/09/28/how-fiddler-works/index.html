<p>There's tons of information scattered through the various Fiddler<br />
sites and this group. </p>
<p>I think you're asking a more specific question: How does Fiddler tell<br />
WinINET that it wants to be the proxy for a given WinINET connection? </p>
<p>Answer: </p>
<p>if (InternetSetOptionList((IntPtr)0,<br />
INTERNET_OPTION_PER_CONNECTION_OPTION, ref Request, size))<br />
{<br />
    InternetSetOption((IntPtr)0,<br />
INTERNET_OPTION_PROXY_SETTINGS_CHANGED, 0, 0);<br />
} </p>

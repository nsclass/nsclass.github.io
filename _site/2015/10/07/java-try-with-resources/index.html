<p>From Java7, it introduced the mechanism to release the resource automatically as C# does with using statement. In C#, you can use the using statement to release resource allocated by object which derives from IDisposable.</p>
<p>[code lang="c"]<br />
using (var socket = new Socket(...)) {</p>
<p>}<br />
[/code]</p>
<p>Java7 can achieve same result with the following syntax. However it cannot use for any object, it can only support the instance which implements java.lang.AutoCloseable as C# does.</p>
<p>[code lang="c"]<br />
try (<br />
    File file = new FileInputStream(...);<br />
    File output = new FileInputStream(...);<br />
) {<br />
}<br />
[/code]</p>
